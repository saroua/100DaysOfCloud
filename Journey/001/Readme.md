# My First Day of 1DOC - Start of the AZ-104 studying path

## Introduction

Today is my first day of 100 Days of Cloud and I'm starting with the start of the AZ-104 Exam preparation learning path

## Prerequisite

You might want to have some basic IT knowledge before going into the AZ-104 learning, or you could also have done the AZ-900 so you have a solid base to start with

## Cloud Research

- I'm using the [AZ-104 Exam preparation course of Cloud Academy](https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/az-104-exam-preparation-microsoft-azure-administrator-1-1332/), i've already used their AZ-900 course and found it quite enjoyable, while not enough for the exam it gave me enough to dive into the MS learn stuff without having to much of a headache ( I learn much better with videos and labs then just by reading)
