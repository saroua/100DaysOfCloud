# Day 2 - AZ-104 Studying - Storage 
## Cloud Research

- Today I learned for about 40 minute, which is less then I'd like but i didn't had much more time sadly to learn more... but I started the chapter on the storage types. Which i struggle a bit with to remember ( queues especially ) as I have for some an issue understanding their usefullness, but I'll dive deeper later on these subject to fully grasp what they mean
